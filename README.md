# dds-rtps
Validation of interoperability of products compliant with [OMG DDS-RTPS standard](http://www.omg.org/spec/DDSI-RTPS/). This is considered one of the core [DDS Specifications](http://portals.omg.org/dds/omg-dds-standard/). See http://portals.omg.org/dds/ for an overview of DDS.

The executables in this repository test discovery, DDS Topic and QoS matching, and interoperability for different QoS settings. The goal is to validate that the implementations perform these functions in compliance with OMG DDS-RTPS standard and can interoperate with each other.
